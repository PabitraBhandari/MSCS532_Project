# Final Evaluation and Performance Analysis

## 1. Performance Comparison

### Initial Proof-of-Concept (Phase 2)
- **Data Structures**: Basic hash tables and linked lists.
- **Performance**: Worked for small datasets but scaled poorly.
- **Scalability Issues**: Inefficient insertions and retrievals with larger datasets.

### Optimized Implementation (Phase 3)
- **Data Structures**: Custom hash table for fast lookups, skip list for ordered data.
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - **Hash Table**: O(1) for insertions, deletions, and lookups.
  - **Skip List**: O(log n) for ordered operations.
- **Scalability**: Handled up to 1,000,000 vehicles efficiently in stress tests.

## 2. Trade-offs Analysis

### Time vs Space Complexity
- **Hash Table**: O(1) time for operations, O(n) space.
- **Skip List**: O(log n) time, but with some additional space overhead.

### Advanced Optimizations
- **Memoization/Caching**: Considered, but unnecessary due to efficient hash table lookups.

## 3. Strengths and Limitations

### Strengths
- **Efficient Parking/Retrieval**: Scales well for large datasets.
- **Modularity**: Flexible and easy to extend.
- **Scalability**: Works with large datasets without major performance drops.

### Limitations
- **Hash Collisions**: Extreme cases of poor hash distribution could impact performance.
- **Memory Usage**: Higher memory use due to both hash table and skip list.

## 4. Potential Improvements
1. **Dynamic Resizing**: Implement smarter resizing for better large dataset handling.
2. **Alternative Data Structures**: Consider a balanced binary search tree for better edge-case performance.
3. **Thread Safety**: Add concurrency controls for multi-threaded environments.

## Conclusion
The optimized system shows significant performance improvements, especially in terms of scalability. While there are trade-offs in memory usage and potential hash collisions, the implementation efficiently handles large datasets.
