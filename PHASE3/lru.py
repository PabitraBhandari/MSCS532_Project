""" 
This code implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache using Python's OrderedDict. 
The cache has a fixed capacity, and when a new item is added that exceeds the capacity, 
the least recently used item (the first item in the dictionary) is removed. The get 
method retrieves a value by key, updating the itemâ€™s position to mark it as recently used, 
while the put method inserts or updates a key-value pair and, if needed, removes the oldest 
entry to maintain the size limit.
